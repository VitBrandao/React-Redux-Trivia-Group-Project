### Welcome to Trivia Project Repository!

Trivia was a group project that I developed alongside with my classmates **Jo√£o Avelino, Maria Gabriela** and **Meiryland Melo** during the **Front-End Module** in the Web Development Course at Trybe.

You can find all the **Components**, **Pages**, **Data** and **Redux Store, Reducers and Actions** by acessing the **/src** directory. 

After creating some **React** applications in the previous projects from beggining of the module, we learned how to use **Redux** to centralize the application states. Trivia was a real challenge to proof both our learning and our soft skills on how to collaborate in a group project.

Besides the challenge of coding using Redux structure, it was a good experience to consolidade our **GitHub skills**, like working on **separated Branches** and **solving conflicts between our codes before Merging in the main branch**.

Trivia was like a quiz game, where the user, after some login validations, had 5 general questions to answer, with 4 answer options. Each question could be answered in a 30 seconds limit time and by the end of the game, each user received his final score. The quiz data came from an external API.
